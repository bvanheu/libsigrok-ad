 *
 * Input file/data format handling.
 *
 * libsigrok can process acquisition data in several different ways.
 * Aside from acquiring data from a hardware device, it can also take it from
 * a file in various formats (binary, CSV, VCD, and so on).
 *
 * Like everything in libsigrok that handles data, processing is done in a
 * streaming manner -- input should be supplied to libsigrok a chunk at a time.
 * This way anything that processes data can do so in real time, without the
 * user having to wait for the whole thing to be finished.
 *
 * Every input module is "pluggable", meaning it's handled as being separate
 * from the main libsigrok, but linked in to it statically. To keep things
 * modular and separate like this, functions within an input module should be
 * declared static, with only the respective 'struct sr_input_format' being
 * exported for use into the wider libsigrok namespace.
