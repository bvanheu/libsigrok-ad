0.2.2 (2013-11-04)
------------------

Note: This release does NOT change the libsigrok API. While new config keys,
      config info types, and unit codes have been added (additional enum
      entries / numbers), no existing interfaces were added/changed/removed.
      Frontends should continue to work fine without recompiling or relinking.

 * New supported hardware:
   - Logic analyzers:
     - Saleae Logic16
   - Thermometers:
     - Center 309
     - UNI-T UT325
     - Voltcraft K204
   - Multimeters:
     - ISOTECH IDM103N
     - Metex M-4650CR
     - Norma DM950
     - Voltcraft M-4650CR
   - Energy meters:
     - EDF Teleinfo
 * New config keys:
   - SR_CONF_VOLTAGE_THRESHOLD
   - SR_CONF_EXTERNAL_CLOCK
   - SR_CONF_SWAP
   - SR_CONF_ENERGYMETER
 * New config info types:
   - SR_T_DOUBLE_RANGE

   - SR_UNIT_VOLT_AMPERE
   - SR_UNIT_WATT
   - SR_UNIT_WATT_HOUR
 * New input modules:
   - csv (comma-separated values)
 * Bump required libzip version to >= 0.10.
 * uni-t-dmm: This driver now requires the specification of the USB VID/PID
   of the cable that is used. Example for sigrok-cli:
    - Old: sigrok-cli --driver voltcraft-vc820 ...
    - New: sigrok-cli --driver voltcraft-vc820:conn=1a86.e008 ...

   - Initial channel swap support (SR_CONF_SWAP).
   - Various minor fixes and improvements.
 * When a frontend adds a device instance to a running session, start
   acquisition on it. This helps with the collectd use-case where devices
   can be removed and added dynamically while a session is running.
 * rigol-ds1xx2: Support newer Linux kernels with USBTMC in /sys/class/usbmisc.
 * rigol-ds1xx2: Also detect the Rigol DS1152E/DS1152D.

0.1.1 (2012-05-30)
------------------

Note: This release does NOT change the libsigrok API.

 * The 'saleae-logic' driver (which depends on the Saleae firmware), has
   been replaced with the new 'fx2lafw' driver, which uses an open-source
   firmware for Cypress FX2 chips which is also named 'fx2lafw'.
   Details: http://sigrok.org/wiki/Fx2lafw
   This new driver (+ firmware) currently supports the following devices:
     - ARMFLY AX-Pro
     - Braintechnology USB-LPS
     - EE Electronics ESLA100
     - EE Electronics ESLA201A
     - Robomotic MiniLogic
     - Robomotic BugLogic 3
     - Saleae Logic
     - USBee AX
     - USBee SX
     - All Cypress FX2 eval boards with stock Cypress VID/PID, including:
       - Lcsoft Mini Board
       - Braintechnology USB Interface V2.x
   Only acquisition with 8 probes is supported so far. Support for 16 probes
   and support for analog signal acquisition (on devices which have these
   capabilities) will be added later.
 * ASIX SIGMA driver:
   - Add support for the ASIX SIGMA2. This requires the latest version of
     the SIGMA/SIGMA2 firmware files.
     Details: http://sigrok.org/wiki/Firmware
   - Various bugfixes.
 * ZEROPLUS Logic Cube LAP-C (16032): Fix a segfault.
 * udev file: Add entries for Robomotic BugLogic 3, Velleman PCSU1000,
   Ideofy LA-08, ARMFLY AX-Pro, and Braintechnology USB Interface V2.x.
 * The zlib dependency has been removed (no longer needed).
 * Fix compiling with "Homebrew" (Mac OS X).
 * libsigrok now expects firmware files in $prefix/share/sigrok-firmware by
   default (was $prefix/share/libsigrok/firmware before).
 * Fix a Makefile.am bug which caused the generated ChangeLog files being
   accidentally deleted upon 'make distclean'.
 * ChronoVu LA8 input file format: Improve autodetection of the file format.
   We now only accept files of the size 8388613 bytes (all LA8 files have
   exactly this amount of bytes).

0.1.0 (2012-04-17)
------------------

 * Initial release.
